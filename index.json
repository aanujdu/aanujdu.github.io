[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at North Carolina State University under the guidance of Dr. Aydin Aysu. I am a member of the hardware security lab of NCSU called HECTOR. My research mainly focuses on a combination of physical side-channel analysis of embedded systems, machine learning, and computer architecture. Currently, I am working towards securing Machine Learning IPs against power and electromagnetic -based side-channel attacks.\nI have served as a co-reviewer to Dr. Aydin Aysu in various top-tier conferences like ICCAD, HOST, FPGA, ReConFig, DATE, etc. I have also been a teaching assistant for the course Cryptographic Engineering and Hardware Security offered at NC State University. I helped with the designing and grading of assignments on varied topics like Differential Power Analysis of cryptographic implementations, hardware design of post-quantum secure implementations (like ring-LWE), etc. I hold a certification by Riscure Inc. on Side-Channel and Fault Analysis of Embedded Systems.\nBefore joining the Ph.D. program, I was an ASIC Design Engineer in the GPU low-power team of NVIDIA Graphics, Bangalore. I contributed to numerous successful ASIC tapeouts during my stint at NVIDIA helping both in the design and verification phases.\n","date":1592265600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1592265600,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://aanujdu.github.io/author/anuj-dubey/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/anuj-dubey/","section":"authors","summary":"I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at North Carolina State University under the guidance of Dr. Aydin Aysu.
